## Overview
A hard mockup for a simple brochure website for a real family business. Created simply with HTML and CSS. Links are disabled, and the site is flat as prototyping the design was the focus. Complete branding including logo creation was involved.

## Client
Rustique is my step-sister's family-run business creating custom farmhouse-style furniture in Southern California. The owners have had rave success but they operate solely through Facebook. A website has been discussed often, and Facebook Messenger widget integrations were even considered. The client has hundreds of photos that the customers love to view. 

## Personal Project Takeaways
This project exercised my knowledge of Flexbox, while expanding more textural designs. It was important to reproduce the style that Rustique creates using a "modern farmhouse" look. This definitely included wood textures, which is very unreasonable to create via SVG or CSS (my preference). Ensuring consistent resolution fidelity was a requirement in the mobile design. The photo grid was created using FLexbox to be able to animate the photos on hover simply by applying flex-grow and flex-shrink properties.
